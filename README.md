# pullOutlookAddresses
Pull just the email addresses from an Outlook formatted list of addresses

If you need all the email addresses, and not the lastName, firstName <address@domain.com>; you can copy the string that Outlook creates, save it to a txt file, and then run this script to just get the addresses.
